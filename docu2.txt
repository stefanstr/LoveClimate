Manual process:
-ocean currents
-hadley/polar cells (pressure systems)
-seasonal pressure systems
-dominant winds
-rain patterns:
	- baseline rain
	- ITCZ, extreme
	- ITCZ, moderate
	- onshore winds
	- mountain rains
	- warm coastal currents
	- polar front
-temperature influencing features:
	- Maritime influence / July and January
	- Continental influence
	- Cold ocean currents / July and January
	- Warm ocean currents / July and January
	- High humidity / July and January
	- Medium elevation
	- High elevation
	- Very high elevation
-add base temperature and adjust
-work out climate zones

Issues/what to improve:
-I want to be able to simulate on a month-by-month, and maybe day-by-day, basis
-I want to be able to work with various orbit and star types
-I want to be able to work on a pixel level
-I want to have greater granularity
-I want to have the systems emerge: e.g., pressure patterns from "real" movement of air masses, ocean currents driven by winds...


Proposal:

1) work out base temperature and base pressure (convection cells)
1a)basic irradiation + orbital position = base temperature -> incoming irradiation, orbit parameters, atmosphere absorption, albedo, greenhouse
1b)rotation speed + season = convection cells -> Hadley/Polar systems, air pressure
2) create base wind patterns -> wind vector (can ignore strenght? will even itself out?)
3) move the winds:
3a)create ocean currents along the winds -> ocean current vector, ocean temperature
3a*create the whole "spirals" and close the loops -> remember Coriolis
3a**adjust sea temperatures (move water along the currents)
3b)create evaporation pattern -> evaporation equation, ground, sea, air humidity
3b*use ground/sea temperature and wind speed to calculate evaporation -> use wind speed or not? or maybe only for this?
3b**adjust air humidity + change temperature of ground and air in the process -> ground temperature, equation of air humidity vs pressure vs temperature
3c)do precipitation.
3c*distribute humidity along the wind
3c**check for saturation -> saturation/rainfall equation, cloud cover parameter (for albedo in next round)
3c***rainfall (or not)->change humidity and temperature

**elevation: important for pressure, temperature and rainfall
